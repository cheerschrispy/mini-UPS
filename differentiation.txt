Product Differentiation

1. Multi-thread
In the backend program, we created two threads that listen to World and Amazon simultaneously and respond to their
messages according. In both threads, we created a new thread to handle a new message, wich improved the scalability
of the server.

2. Database
We created a database to store all the infirmation about each package. With this database, we can match each package
with its delivering truck, owner account and current status. We updated the database in real-time with any messages
from World or Amazon.

3. Account update
Users can update their registered email address at any time. This allows users to select their email address flexibly.

4. Email notification
When a user update the delivery address or when a delivery is made, users will receive a notification email.

5. Communication with Amazon
When a delivery is made, our UPS server will send a message to Amazon, so that Aamzon can update the status of an order.
